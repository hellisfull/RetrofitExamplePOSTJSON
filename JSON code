        "description": "Having volunteers is a big part of who we are here at the Mission. Not only do we benefit from the different perspectives, skills and ideas that volunteers bring with them, we also feel it is important to help inspire others who seek to be of service in the world. When it’s done right, it’s a win-win-win, with our kids being the third winner as they get to meet so many new people.\n\nThis week, our volunteer cup truly runneth over, with a host of fun, talented new arrivals creating a whirl wind of energy and activity across the Mission grounds.",

        "description": "There was a time when Johnson Kapithanparambil was an alcoholic; a ruffian, who picked up a fight for no real reason.\n\nHe underwent a de-addiction programme later and emerged a reformed man.\n\nBut the real transforming moment came 17 years ago on a day when he came across an extended hand of a miserable looking beggar outside a church.\n\nJohnson fed him. The radiant smile on the beggar’s face triggered a messianic zeal in him to feed the poor, which he continues till day.\n\nThat he leads a near hand-to-mouth existence hasn’t stopped this casual labourer from Elamkunnapuzha.\n\nInitially, he started with feeding people once in a week. Before long, he was serving food to the poor and the destitute every day.\n\nJohnson now serves a fish-curry meal, some days meat replaces fish, to 40-odd persons every day by dropping of the food packs at four select points in and around Vypeen.\n\nHe also serves food to the inmates of Njarakkal Government Hospital four days a week. Besides, he also gives food to Malayattoor pilgrims on Good Friday every year. “This year, we are planning to feed around 2,000 pilgrims,” he said.\n\nHe has scheduled his work around his humanitarian service. “I won’t work for three hours in the afternoon no matter how lucrative the remuneration is,” he said. So he works in two shifts from 7.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. and then from 2.30 p.m. till the work finishes.\n\nBut Johnson’s day begins even earlier. He and his wife wake up as early as 1 a.m. to start preparing the food. On an average it costs Rs.1,500 to meet a day’s expenses against his average daily income of Rs.2,000.\n\nNowadays people come forward to support him though he doesn’t accept money.\n\nJohnson also helps the destitute find shelter by networking with organisations like Theruvoram. He is also in touch with 50-odd hospitals, orphanages, shelter homes and homes for the differently-abled serving them food, clothes and even medicines received as contributions.",

        "description": "KOZHIKODE: The implementation of JJ Act will help another important stakeholder besides the child- the childless couple who are waiting in the queue for  adoption.  In Kerala,  over 700 prospective parents are waiting for kids whereas there are only 25 legally fit children for adoption.\n\nThis glaring gap could be bridged by exposing these children to  adoption, foster care, sponsorship etc. “Actually JJ Act ensures security for all orphanages.  The  child is the biggest beneficiary. The institution also benefits as there would be government protection. Once they come under the Act, all orphanages must take the children recommended by the CWC. That might be the reason some orphanages are hesitant,” observed Sister Jane Augustine, director of St Vincent Home. \n\nShe added that childless couple would find the Act a boon as there is a  shortage of  children fit to be adopted. This  had  forced couples to seek children from other states. According to the data from the State Adoption Resource Agency (SARA), 41 kids were adopted from out of Kerala in 2014 and 20 of them are from Odisha  followed by Maharasthra, Karnataka and Jharkhand.\n\nThe shortage of adoptive children has spurred  the kids’ sale racket. The childless couples fall prey to the sinister designs of the racket which often involves advocates and doctors. In 2014 alone, five such sold-out incidents were tracked and in all cases, the children were bought by childless couples.",

        "description": "The rapid increase in the number of residents in old-age homes in Kerala during recent times has set off alarm bells in the Department of Social justice.\n\nAccording to information made available by the Government Home for the Aged, Kollam, there has been a 69 per cent increase in the number of residents of old-age homes in the State over the past four years.\n\nMoreover, a recent study by HelpAge India concluded that Kerala, among all the States, has the maximum number of old-age homes.\n\nIn 1961, those above 60 years constituted 5.8 per cent of the national population, which rose to 6.8 per cent in 1991. In 2016, the figure is expected to be 8.9 per cent. Going by the 1991 figures, the rate of growth of the aged is over 60 per cent, which is more than the rate of growth of the total population. Among the aged, the growth rate of those aged above 70 is greater than that of those aged above 60.\n\nAccording to UN estimates, the aged population in the world is expected to touch 22 per cent by 2050. In 2006, the aged constituted 11 per cent of the world population.\n\nThe rate of increase in the aged population in Kerala is higher than that of the other States.\n\nThe percentage of the aged in Kerala was 5.83 in 1961. In 1991, this rose to 8.82 per cent - higher than the national figure - and became 9.79 per cent in 2001. Going by this trend, the aged in Kerala will constitute 16 per cent of the total population by 2021 and 20 per cent by 2026.\n\nA significant feature of the aged population in Kerala is the number of widows. In 1991, among those aged 60 to 69, only 5 per cent were widowers.\n\nHowever, the percentage of widows in this age group was 53.8. Among those aged above 70, this percentage nearly doubles.\n\nIt is to find ways to address the needs of this rapidly increasing aged population that the department has given shape to the programme ‘Thanalekiavarku Thanalekaam’(Lets Shelter Those who Sheltered Us). The awareness programme will be launched at a programme to be held on October 1 at the old-age home in Kollam.",

        "description": "Monitoring of private-run orphanages in the State is back in focus after allegations surfaced last week of a young woman from an orphanage in Kozhikode being forcibly married off to a UAE national and later divorced.\n\nWith the mushrooming of illegal orphanages, the safety of children residing in them has been a cause of concern. In 2013 alone, eight cases of sexual abuse were reported from private orphanages in the State as per the Board of Control of Orphanages and Other Charitable Homes. The unreported ones could far outnumber this, say officials. A May 2011 circular from the State Police Chief says that “a number of unregistered orphanages in the State are potential breeding grounds for human trafficking.”\n\nKerala has 2,200 recognised orphanages which are run mostly by NGOs and charitable organisations. The system of recognition was changed in the last decade with these institutions now being given the certificate only for four years at a time. Once this period expires, fresh inspections are conducted to check if they meet the standards. “Before 2009, the conditions for recognition were less stringent. There was no system to renew the recognition periodically. They did not have to maintain the conditions once the initial check was over,” says P.C. Ibrahim, Chairman of the Board of Control of Orphanages and Other Charitable Homes.\n\nIn 2011-12, the board closed down 69 orphanages across the State for not meeting standards and for various violations. But these standards lay little thrust on the qualifications of the staff members who interact with the children. In many cases, they have been found to be responsible for abuse. In September last year, the secretary of an orphanage in Kannur was arrested after he was found to have abused seven girls below the age of 15.\n\n“Currently, there is no arrangement to check the background of people who take care of the children. The board members of the specific institution select the caretakers. We train them,” says Mr. Ibrahim.\n\nK.E. Gangadharan, member of the State Human Rights Commission says the management’s credentials and the caretakers’ qualifications must be checked thoroughly before such institutions are allowed to function.\n\nHe says that the flow of funds, from abroad even, attracts those with an eye on profits into setting up such institutions. A careful study of the management’s nature and their past work needs to be conducted before an institution is allowed to function.\n\nThe government also gives Rs.1,700 grant per child every month. In addition, each child gets 7 kg of rice and 3 kg of wheat.",
